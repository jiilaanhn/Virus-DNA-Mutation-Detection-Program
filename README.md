# Virus-DNA-Mutation-Detection-Program
This program detects DNA mutations in viruses using global sequence alignment techniques as an implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

The output are homology percentage, Needleman-Wunsch Score, identities, gap, nucleotide base mutations and their locations, optimal results of global sequence alignment.

This program has been validated through thesis research by comparing its output to the results of genome annotation research and analysis of the evolution of the Monkeypox virus by Wang, et al in 2022.
